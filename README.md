# Exploratory Data Analysis of Multi-Mall Shopping Data using SQL

This project involves performing in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a synthetic multi-mall shopping dataset using SQL. It aims to uncover trends, customer behavior patterns, sales distribution, and revenue insights across different malls, genders, age groups, and product categories.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset (customer_shopping_data) contains the following fields:

- `invoice_no`
- `customer_id`
- `gender`
- `age`
- `category`
- `quantity`
- `price`
- `total_amount`
- `payment_method`
- `invoice_date`
- `shopping_mall`

## Key Analysis Performed

- Total and unique customer count
- Overall and monthly revenue analysis
- Top performing malls and product categories
- Revenue breakdown by gender and age groups
- Payment method usage patterns
- Basket size (average items per transaction)
- Peak shopping days per mall
- Product preferences by gender
- Age-wise spending behavior

## Insights Highlight

- Mall of Instabul and Kanyon outperform other malls in terms of revenue.
- Age groups **40â€“49** and **20â€“29** are the highest spenders.
- Most common payment method varies across age groups.
